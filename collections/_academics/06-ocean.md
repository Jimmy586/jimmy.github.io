title: Resume Screening
link: #
description: While looking for internship or job, it is always a real pain to receive tons of rejection email from everywhere. This made me think of starting to look for a resume dataset and keywords HR people are really looking for in job applicant CV to retain them more than 30s, which is the average time spent on resume screening. This is a machine learning project, based on NLP to analyse the sequences of the words/sentences which will retain more attention from the HR people, and the optimize job applicant's chance to get hired.
... a work in progress (repo to be updated soon)
