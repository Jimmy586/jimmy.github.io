title: Base Station power consumption estimation with power saving techniques
link: https://github.com/Jimmy586/Cellular_Base_Stations_Power_Consumption_Analysis
description: * The main topic of my research was to find key indicators and approaches to tackle power greediness of BS and apply the result to the BS stations here in France.
  To do this we were equiped with the open-source from ANFR to estimate the power consumed by BS in France and then analyse the key factor influencing these consumptions, and then design approaches to save energy in a seamless way without too much affecting the QOS.
