description: This was is a personnal project I started to try many different Machine Learning libraries and packages, try their performances on different type of project and compare their accuracies. This project is still ongoing since the Machine learning domain is an ever evolving field, so I continuously train myself to follow the state of the art on many different technologies of Machine learning and Deep Learning (GAN, NLP, Supervised and Unsupervised learning, etc..)
