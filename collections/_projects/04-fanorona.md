link: https://github.com/Jimmy586/DataAnalysis_ProbabilisticModeling
description: This small project contains various concept and techniques of advanced statistics and Machine learning . This is a way for me to sharpen my quick understanding and my familiarization with data. It is still an ongoing project since it's a long way process to learn the theoritical part of Machine learning and data engineering, however I am a math lover so this is one of the fun part of my carrer.
