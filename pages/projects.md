        <strong>Machine Learning Engineer Intern (Feb. 2024 - Aug. 2024)</strong><br>
        Developed a PCB components detector program and reference extraction with Yolov8, OCR, and Fuzzy Matching. Customized LLMs and LLM4Decompile Model on local cluster machines for company-related use cases and reverse engineering tasks. Built fully automated CI/CD pipelines from a self-hosted GitLab to a local cluster machine using K8s and Ansible. Reduced overall time spent by hardware pentesters on security assessments.<br>
        <em>Tech Stack: Yolo, OpenCV, OCR, RAG/GraphRAG, LLM, Pytorch, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Python, GitLab.</em>

        <strong>Research Assistant Intern (May 2023 - Sep. 2023)</strong><br>
        Developed strategies to save energy for mobile networks based on key factors, improving the EARTH Model. Acquired and prepared data (ETL with PowerBI) from ANFR and used queue learning for future traffic load adaptation. Applied the approach to real traffic load data in Rennes, saving up to 20% of energy.<br>
        <em>Tech Stack: 5G, PowerBI, Pandas, Python, GitLab, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.</em>

      <p class="dark:text-stone-300">
        <strong>System Architecture and School Projects (2022 - Present)</strong><br>
        Designed and deployed the SuperApp azplus.mg based in Madagascar, moved the infrastructure to GCP/Microservices. Developed a Euro coin recognizer using computer vision for mobile devices. Worked on cloud-based noise processing with Raspberry Pi for queue prediction and speech-to-text using NLP.<br>
        <em>Tech Stack: GCP, Kubernetes, Minio, ElasticSearch, Yolo, OpenCV, Whisper, Python, Docker, Keras, SQL, JAVA.</em>
