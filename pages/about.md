      Interning at IMT Atlantique Rennes in the summer of 2023 was pivotal, allowing him to contribute to a research project aimed at reducing the energy consumption of 4G and 5G base stations in France using Machine Learning. This project showcases his technical expertise and commitment to creating sustainable solutions. The project is available <a class="text-gray-500 dark:text-stone-300" href="https://github.com/Jimmy586/Cellular_Base_Stations_Power_Consumption_Analysis" target="_blank">here</a>. Supervised by <a class="text-gray-500 dark:text-stone-300" href="https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en/person/loutfi-nuaymi" target="_blank">Pr Loutfi NYAUMI</a> and Christopher MERLHE, he redesigned the EARTH model, making a more accurate estimation of base stations' power consumption, detecting key factors influencing it, and proposing strategies to save energy seamlessly. The project saved up to 20% of energy consumption for a base station in Rennes.

      His internship at <a class="text-gray-500 dark:text-stone-300" href="https://www.serma-safety-security.com/en/" target="_blank">Serma Safety and Security</a> from February to August 2024 involved developing a Computer Vision Model to detect PCB components through their unique shapes and identifiers, reducing time spent by cybersecurity engineers on hardware assessments. Additionally, he worked on neural-based decompilers using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to convert assembly language files into high-level C code, a crucial process for reverse engineering tasks. This work was based on the Meta-published paper "<a class="text-gray-500 dark:text-stone-300" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/introducing-n-bref-a-neural-based-decompiler-framework/" target="_blank">N-Bref</a>". He used Python libraries such as Yolov10, OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas, solidifying his expertise in these tools.
